			Lloyd Morrisett notices that his young daughter, Sarah, is fascinated by television and especially catchy commercials. He brought this up at a dinner party with friends who began to wonder if the power of television could be harnessed to teach preschool children.<br><br><br><br>
			<strong>1967</strong><br>
			Joan Ganz Cooney, friend of Morrisett and publicist for Channel 13, took a leave of absence to interview experts in child development, education, and television. Her findings were summarized in a 55-page report, which provided substantial evidence for the potential of a new form of children’s television.

			<em>“Anyone who has small television viewers at home can testify to the fascination that commercials hold for children. Parents report that their children learn to recite all sorts of advertising slogans, read product names on the screen and sing commercial jingles… 
			If we accept the premise that commercials are effective teachers, it is important to be aware of their characteristics, the most obvious being frequent repetition, clever visual presentation, brevity, and clarity.”</em><br>
