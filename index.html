			Lloyd Morrisett, future co-founder of Sesame Street, noticed that his young daughter, Sarah, was fascinated by television and especially catchy commercials. He brought this up at a dinner party with friends who wondered whether the power of television could be harnessed to teach preschool children.<br><br><br><br>
			<strong>1967</strong><br>
			Joan Ganz Cooney, friend of Lloyd Morrisett and publicist for WNET/Channel 13, took a leave of absence to interview experts in child development, education and television. Her findings were summarized in a 55-page report that provided substantial evidence for the potential of a new form of children’s television.

			<em>“Anyone who has small television viewers at home can testify to the fascination that commercials hold for children. Parents report that their children learn to recite all sorts of advertising slogans, read product names on the screen and sing commercial jingles… 
			If we accept the premise that commercials are effective teachers, it is important to be aware of their characteristics, the most obvious being frequent repetition, clever visual presentation, brevity, and clarity.”</em><br>

			<h4><strong>1968</strong><br>
				The Children’s Television Workshop was founded by Lloyd Morrisett and Joan Ganz Cooney to produce an educational show that would be sculpted through research, preschool focus groups and a bit of creativity. The U.S. Department of Education provided half of the $8 million budget needed to sustain the initial research and first season of the show. The Carnegie Corporation, Ford Foundation and Corporation for Public Broadcasting provided the other half. The focus of the show was to make education accessible and engaging for urban or poor preschoolers whose parents might not have the time or resources to provide it for them.

			<h4><strong>1970</strong><br>
				Kermit sang about "Bein' Green," which Sesame Street said had a focus on "being comfortable in your own skin, [and] being comfortable with who you are.”
				<br><br>
				Kermit retired from the Sesame Street cast after the first season. His appearances in cigarette commercials and shows for adults seemed to compromise the integrity of his character as a good-natured teacher on Sesame Street.
				<br><br>
			
				The state of Mississippi voted to ban the show because of its multiracial cast. Once the decision was publicized nationally the decision was rescinded.
				<br><br>
				Meanwhile, Roosevelt Franklin was the first African-American Muppet. He taught students about the geography of Africa and how to avoid drinking poison. Parents wrote to the Children’s Television Workshop to complain that Roosevelt was a negative stereotype of African-American children. They cited his rowdy nature and the fact that his classes closely resembled after-school detention.

			<h4><strong>Thanksgiving, 1983</strong><br>
				Sesame Street addressed death when actor Will Lee, who played Mr. Hooper, died in 1982. Sesame Street producers debated whether to cast a replacement or remove the role from the show. Opting for the latter, adult characters on the show took this opportunity to explain death to Big Bird, who didn't understand why Mr. Hooper wasn't coming back. The show caused a stir among parents who believed their children were still too young to be burdened by death.

				Snuffleupagus was finally introduced to the rest of the cast when a connection was drawn between the character and pedophilia. The writers worried that by discounting Big Bird's relationship with Snuffleupagus, the Sesame Street adults might be sending the message to children that they would not be believed if they reported sexual assault.

			<h4><strong>1993</strong><br>
				Since the first season of the show, some audiences suspected that Bert and Ernie were more than roommates. In 1993, Sesame Street's producers stated that Bert and Ernie "did not portray a gay couple, and there were no plans for them to do so in the future. Like all the Muppets created for Sesame Street, they were designed to help educate preschoolers. Bert and Ernie are characters who help demonstrate to children that despite their differences, they can be good friends."

				Elmo had grown quite popular in recent years, having been a background character since the 1980s. Elmo’s World was introduced as a show-within-a-show with a “stream of consciousness” feel to it, as if a child’s squiggly crayon drawing was coming to life. Since the debut of his own segment, Elmo receives more screen time on Sesame Street than any other character. Elmo is an “exuberant, inquisitive, trusting, innocent, playful star.”

				The South African edition of Sesame Street introduced Kami, a 5-year-old HIV-positive character whose mother died of AIDS. Critics immediately sent angry letters to producers, saying the show was promoting homosexuality and prematurely educating children on the disease. A few years later former President Bill Clinton appeared with Kami in a PSA about HIV/AIDS.

				Cookie Monster is joined by Veggie Monster. After years of chanting "me want cookie," Cookie Monster was given a new diet of fruits and vegetables. With childhood obesity on the rise in the U.S., Sesame Street began teaching kids about healthy eating. The show came out with the song "A Cookie is a Sometime Food" to teach kids that cookies shouldn't be eaten all the time.

The music video, a revised version of Perry's hit "Hot 'N Cold," was released online, instantly sparking a controversy over the appropriateness of Perry's cleavage-showing outfit.

				<strong>Other results from Sesame Street programming include:</strong><br><br>
				American children who regularly view Sesame Street as preschoolers achieve high school grade point averages that are 16% higher than those who don't.<br><br>
				Bangladesh 4-year-olds who watch Sesame Street have 67% higher literacy scores than those who don't watch.<br><br>
